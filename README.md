# Visit Central Pennsylvania

This is my second Milestone project, which includes the language JavaScript. I decided to do my own project, which is a webpage that invites people to tour two cities in Central Pennsylvania, Altoona and Gallitzen, over a two day period. Visitors will have ample time to visit the some important railroad sights and a railroad museum, and to see Baker Mansion and the colonial Fort Roberdeau.

### Design Choices

#### Colors

I used four fall colors for this site - goldenrod, dark green, slate-grey and mild blue.  I feel that this area looks espescially handsome in the fall, at which time these colors can be spotted.

#### Icons

The icon in this website was taken from Font Awesome.  I chose the train icon.

### User Experience - Information, Presentaion, Look and Feel

My goal was to develop the simplest-style webpage, so that the user would naturally and easily see what to do and how to do it, while knowing that they were being included in an important region of Pennsylvania railroad history.

The first thing the user sees is the browser-size photo of a Limekiln, a giant oven which burns up limestone until it becomes quicklime, an important ingredient in mortar.  While this has nothing to do with the railroad, it is, like the iron-making Allegheny Furnace, one of the fascinating historic items that one may see in the area of central Pennsylvania.

Next, the user will be told what the vacation is, and how it's going to happen: The users will visit six places, some historic buildings and some railroad museums (which will be dicussed further down in this description), over a period of two days.  They will stay in a nice hotel, and over the course of each working day (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) they will be taken by bus to these various destinations with the other users.  To make sure they have ample time to explore each of the different sights, they will see only three of the six places in a day.  Otherwise, they can enjoy the local restaurants and the area in general, which is a railroad region dotted with historic sights and markers.

Now the user can see the list of the different sights to be visited and read a brief description of the places.  On one day, they will visit Fort Roberdeau, a colonial wooden fort, built to protect the mining trade from the native-Americans and the English. They will also visit two interesting railroad sights in Gallitzin, PA.  On the other day, they will visit Baker Mansion, a stone mansion built by the wealthy iron-making Bakers in the 1840's, the cost of which ruined the Bakers.  Next, they will visit the Horseshoe Curve, the "eigth wonder of the world", a natural railroad track roundabout, which, in the 1850's, is the only passage for railroad trains to take to make it further west.  This place was important enough to be be at the top of the bombing sights made by the German army during WW II.  Finally the user will visit the Altoona Railroad Museum, a great railroad museum.  Altoona was built solely as a railroad town in 1854.

The user will be able to see the location of all these sights on the Google Map, a great tool that shows one the real location of these sights and where they are with respect to one another.

Lastly, the user will find an email page, which they will use to contact the site-holder to make arrangements.

## Wireframe

## Features

Hero Image - First the user will see a Hero image of a Limekiln (description of a Limekiln given above), which is a giant picture of the thing with the phrase "Visit Central Pennsylvania" written over it.  I mention this as a feature because I feel the Hero image gives the website a single established and unifying mark, the one big hub around which the smaller things are grouped.

Home Page - The vacation description, the sights visited, the map and the email are all found on one homepage, which has been quarted to fit each of the things just listed.  I mention this as a feature because the site is so simply done for the user, it only needs an easy to navigate Home page to hold it all together.

Google Map - This is a great feature and tool to use on a website.  Other than giving the user the coordinate location of the place, the map will also show them the highways and the streets that the site is located on - right down to showng the vehicle moving along the street as it heads to the location.

Email - There is an email contact sight, which the user will use to contact the site holders for information and to make arrangements.

Train Icon - A train icon put before the description of each of the sights visiting locations.

## Resources

The following were used as learning resources throughout the building of this project:

1. Code Institute
2. Slack - Code Institutes Community
3. W3Schools
4. Youtube
5. Markdown

## Bugs

The only bug that I had was that the coordinates given by Wikipedia were incorrect, and put the locations in the wrong place.  I fixed this problem by going to  a different website called LatLong, which gave me the correct map coordinates.

## Media

## Testing

### Code Validation

1. I passed index.html through W3C Markup Validation Service and it showed no errors.

### Manual Testing

1. Every map marker was checked to make sure that it accurately shows where the place is located.   
2. The email was checked to make sure that the email was sent to my email account.
3. The social links were checked to make sure that they took the user to the links webpage.

### Testing User Stories

1. As a user, I want to understand what the site is for - It is clear to the users that they could visit Central Pennsylvania on a two day tour.

2. As a user, I want to find interesting places to visit - This is achieved by describing the places to visit with a breif and accurate description.

3. As a user, I want to see the locations of the places to visit - This is achieved by placing markers on Google Maps.

4. As a user, I want to have good accommodations while I stay - This is achieved by putting the user in a fine local hotel.

5. As a user, I want to be able to contact the site holder immediately - This is achieved by placing an email form at the end of the site.

## Deployment To Github Pages

1. I sign into github and go to 'My Repositories".
2. I find the repository 'Milestone project 2' and choose that.
3. I find 'settings' and choose that.
4. I scroll down to 'github pages' and select that.
5. I find 'source' on the github pages and choose "master branch'.
6. I enter that, and the url address for my website appears.
