# Visit Central Pennsylvania

This is my second Milestone project, which includes the language JavaScript. I decided to do my own project, which is a webpage that invites people to tour two cities in Central Pennsylvania, Altoona and Gallitzen, over a two day period. Visitors will have ample time to visit the some important railroad sights and a railroad museum, and to see Baker Mansion and the colonial Fort Roberdeau.

## UX

###User Stories

User Goals

1. As a user, I want to make my way through the website easily.
2. As a user, I want to know what's going on, what's being offered.
3. As a user, I want to know where I'll be and why.
4. As a user, I want to know why this is important.
5. As a user, I want to know more about the town where the attraction is located.

User Goals Met

1. This sitght fulfills the user goal by using a a very simple  fail-safe design.
2. This sight turns the happenings of the tour into part of the sales pitch.
3. This sight constantly reminds the user of precisely where they are in the world and why they are there.
4. This sight will put the users in a place where they will have the importance of the place explained to 
   them.
5. This sight will have the users be where they can find out much more about Altoona and Gallitzen.  

###User Experience

My goal was to develop the simplest-style webpage, so that the user would naturally and easily see what to do and how to do it, while knowing that they were being included in an important region of Pennsylvania railroad history.

The first thing the user sees is the browser-size photo of a Limekiln, a giant oven which burns up limestone until it becomes quicklime, an important ingredient in mortar.  While this has nothing to do with the railroad, it is, like the iron-making Allegheny Furnace, one of the fascinating historic items that one may see in the area of central Pennsylvania.

Next, the user will be told what the vacation is, and how it's going to happen: The vacationers will visit six places, some historic buildings and some railroad museums (which will be dicussed further down in this description), over a period of two days.  They will stay in a nice hotel, and over the course of each working day (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.) they will be taken by bus to these various destinations with the other vacationers.  To make sure they have ample time to explore each of the different sights, they will see only three of the six places in a day.  Otherwise, they can enjoy the local restaurants and the area in general, which is a railroad region dotted with historic sights and markers.

Now the user can see the list of the different sights to be visited and read a brief description of the places.  On one day, they will visit Fort Roberdeau, a colonial wooden fort, built to protect the mining trade from the native-Americans and the English. They will also visit two interesting railroad sights in Gallitzin, PA.  On the other day, they will visit Baker Mansion, a stone mansion built by the wealthy iron-making Bakers in the 1840's, the cost of which ruined the Bakers.  Next, they will visit the Horseshoe Curve, the "eigth wonder of the world", a natural railroad track roundabout, which, in the 1850's, is the only passage for railroad trains to take to make it further west.  This place was important enough to be be at the top of the bombing sights made by the German army during WW II.  Finally the vacationer will visit the Altoona Railroad Museum, a great railroad museum.  Altoona was built solely as a railroad town in 1854.

The user will be able to see the location of all these sights on the Google Map, a great tool that shows one the real location of these sights and where they are with respect to one another.

Lastly, the user will find an email page, which they will use to contact the site-holder to make arrangements.

## Features

Hero Image - First the user will see a Hero image of a Limekiln (description of a Limekiln given above), which is a giant picture of the thing with the phrase "Visit Central Pennsylvania" written over it.  I feel the Hero image makes the website seem more established, as if it were layed on a good foundation.

Home Page - The vacation description, the sights visited, the map and the email are all found on one homepage, which has been quarted to fit each of the things just listed.  This website is so simply-styled that, other than the Hero image, all that it needs is a Homepage.

Google Map - I mentioned the map before.  This is a great feature and tool to use on a website.  I haven't said this yet, but, other than giving the user just the coordinates of the the place, the map will also show one the highways and the streets that the site is located on.

Email - There is an email contact sight, which the user will use to contact the vacation givers for information and to make arrangements.

Train Icon - A train icon put before the description of each of the sights visiting locations.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
4. JavaScript

## Testing

The webpage had it's HTML and CSS checked by W3School's code validator to see if they were correct. All of the code was tested with DevTools. The site was viewed on several different sizes of computer to ensure that it looked good responsively.

## Deployment To Github Pages

1. I sign into github and go to 'My Repositories".
2. I find the repository 'Milestone project 2' and choose that.
3. I find 'settings' and choose that.
4. I scroll down to 'github pages' and select that.
5. I find 'source' on the github pages and choose "master branch'.
6. I enter that, and the url address for my website appears.
7. 'Milestone project 2' is now live on github pages.

##Media

I used Google Images for the Hero image.

## Credit

I used Code Institute's Resume program for body design and for icons that come before Locations.
