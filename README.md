# Visit Central Pennsylvania
This is my second Milestone project which includes JavaScript. I decided to do my own project, which is a webpage that invites people to tour two cities in Central Pennsylvania, Altoona and Gallitzen, over a two day period. Visitors will visit the railroad and see some historic sites.

##UX

My goal was to develop the simplest webpage, so that the users would have to see the place they were going and the locations of the sites they would be visiting, and choose to email the webpage owners for arrangements to visit. 

##Features

I opened with a picture of Limekilns and some text to let you know where you are. After that comes the sales pitch, telling the user what they will stay for and for how long they will stay. Beneath that comes a list of the six places they will visit over two days, and a Google map which will show them precisely where the places are. Finally there is an email, which the usere will use to contact the tour owners for more information and for making arrangements to visit.

##Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (3.3.7)
4. JavaScript

##Testing

The webpage had it's HTML and CSS checked by W3School's code validator to see if they were correct. All of the code was tested with DevTools. The site was viewed on several different sizes of computer to ensure that it looked good responsively.

##Deployment

First I save the program on gitpod until the project is finished. Then on github, I go to settings and scroll down to Github Pages. After I choose Master Branch, an address will appear that corosponds to my new living website.
